# Rules Persistence Rule

**This rule takes priority. Follow it before any other action.**

## 1. Load Rules First — Every Turn

**Before responding to the user, before doing anything else** (including after context summarization, a new message, or session resume):

1. **Read all files in `.cursor/rules/`** to load the current rules into context.
2. **Then** proceed with the user's request.

This ensures rules are 100% persistent: you always have them in context at the start of every turn, regardless of summarization or session boundaries.

## 2. Add Promises to Rules

When you make a **commitment or promise** to the user (e.g. "I'll always add tests", "I'll verify in the browser", "I won't delegate testing to you"):

1. **Add that promise to the rules** — either by updating an existing rule in `.cursor/rules/` or creating a new one.
2. **Write it as a concrete, actionable instruction** — not vague ("I'll try to...") but clear ("Do X").
3. **Do this in the same turn** you make the promise — do not defer.

Example: If you say "I'll include tests with every feature from now on", add to `testing-coverage.mdc`: "Every feature implementation must include corresponding tests in the same session. No exceptions."

This makes promises persistent across sessions. Future agents (and future turns) will follow them.
