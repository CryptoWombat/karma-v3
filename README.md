# Karma Platform v3

Planning and specification for the Karma Platform rebuild.

## Contents

- **docs/** — Product Requirements Document (PRD) and supporting materials
  - `PRD_KARMA_PLATFORM_REBUILD.md` — Full PRD (Markdown)
  - `PRD_KARMA_PLATFORM_REBUILD.docx` — Full PRD (Word)
  - `md_to_docx.py` — Script to regenerate the Word document from Markdown

## Purpose

This repository holds the planning artifacts for the complete rebuild of the Karma Platform, kept separate from the existing [Karma-api2](https://github.com/roeilevav/Karma-api2) codebase to avoid impacting the current production system.

## Next Steps

When ready to implement, use the PRD as the source of truth and build the new platform in this repository or a dedicated implementation repo.
